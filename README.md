## Installation

Here’s how you might use the flutter tool to create, analyze, test, and run an app:

`$ flutter create my_app`

`$ cd my_app`

`$ flutter analyze`

`$ flutter test`

`$ flutter run lib/main.dart`

To run pub commands using the flutter tool:

`$ flutter pub get`

`$ flutter pub outdated`

`$ flutter pub upgrade`

To view all commands that flutter supports:

`$ flutter --help --verbose`

To get the current version of the Flutter SDK, including its framework, engine, and tools:

`$ flutter --version`

## Why Start this project
I wrote this project with Flutter framework and it is my first project with Flutter framework 
and I know that the code I wrote can be written much better because it is my first project.
maybe later there will be updates to improve the performance.

### I made a checklist here of the things I did in this project

- [x] Creating a splash page.
- [x] Implement ripple animation for the splash screen.
- [x] Getting data from the server using Jibers api.
- [x] Show the web view to choose the language that there are two languages to choose, Farsi and English.
- [x] Then select the language that is selected to be saved in the program.
- [x] and navigate to the intro pages according to the selected language.
- [x] After introducing the application in the intro pages, navigate to the user's account login page which is done with webview.
- [x] Instant check of internet connection, which will stop using the program as soon as the internet is interrupted.
- [x] Implementing the design of the definitive Internet user interface that I did with Bottom Sheet.
